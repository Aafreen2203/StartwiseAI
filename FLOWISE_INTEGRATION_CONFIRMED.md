# ‚úÖ Your Flowise API Integration - CONFIRMED

## Yes, I am using YOUR Flowise API!

**Your Flowise API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/prediction/ef70d4dd-adea-47c3-9e1c-217214805adc`

This endpoint has been **preserved** and is now being used with the enhanced StartwiseAI evaluation format.

## What Just Happened:

### ‚úÖ **Updated Your Existing `flowiseApi.ts`**:

- **Kept your exact Flowise API URL**
- **Enhanced the prompt** to request 6-section evaluations instead of 10-section pitch decks
- **Updated interfaces** to use StartwiseAI format
- **Improved response processing** for better evaluation parsing

### ‚úÖ **Your Flowise Agent Will Now Receive**:

```
You are StartwiseAI, an expert startup evaluation agent. Analyze the following startup idea comprehensively...

Please provide a comprehensive startup evaluation covering these 6 essential sections:

## 1. Uniqueness Check
## 2. Tech Stack Recommendation
## 3. Pitch Generation
## 4. Similar Startups
## 5. Improvement Suggestions
## 6. Success Probability & Market Stats
```

### ‚úÖ **Application Flow**:

```
User Input ‚Üí Your Flowise API ‚Üí AI Agent ‚Üí 6-Section Evaluation ‚Üí Clean Parsing ‚Üí Display
```

## üß™ Test Right Now:

1. **Your Flowise Server**: Make sure it's running on `localhost:3000`
2. **Test Input**: Try the VR workspace idea:
   - "A VR-based workspace that boosts focus using ambient music and haptic feedback"
3. **Expected Output**: Your AI agent should now receive the enhanced evaluation prompt and return structured analysis

## üîç What Your Flowise Agent Should Return:

If your agent is properly configured, you should get responses like:

```
## Uniqueness Check
Analysis of existing VR workspace solutions like Spatial.io, Immersed, and Horizon Workrooms...

## Tech Stack Recommendation
Unity 3D engine, Oculus SDK, WebRTC for collaboration, spatial audio APIs...

## Pitch Generation
"FocusVR creates immersive virtual workspaces that boost productivity by 40%..."

## Similar Startups
- Spatial.io: $25M Series A, focus on meetings
- Immersed: Bootstrap success, individual productivity...

## Improvement Suggestions
Add eye-tracking for attention metrics, integrate with Slack/Teams...

## Success Probability & Market Stats
VR market growing at 31.12% CAGR, remote work adoption at 87%...
```

## üö® Important Notes:

1. **Your Flowise Flow**: Make sure your AI agent in Flowise can handle the new evaluation prompt format
2. **Response Structure**: Your agent should return content with clear section headers (## Section Name)
3. **Data Sources**: If your agent has access to startup databases or market data via RAG, it will provide much better responses

## üéØ Quick Test:

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8081` and submit a startup idea. Check the browser console to see:

- The request being sent to YOUR Flowise API
- The response received from YOUR Flowise API
- How it's being parsed into the 6 evaluation sections

**Your Flowise API endpoint is fully preserved and now enhanced for comprehensive startup evaluations!** üöÄ
