# StartwiseAI - Comprehensive Startup Evaluation Agent

## üöÄ Project Overview

**StartwiseAI** is an advanced startup idea evaluation agent that provides comprehensive analysis using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and AI-powered insights. Unlike simple pitch deck generators, StartwiseAI evaluates your startup from multiple angles to give you actionable, data-driven recommendations.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Complete Workflow)

- Scalability and cost considerations
- Development timeline estimates

#### 3. **Pitch Generation**

- Investor-ready elevator pitch (2-3 sentences)
- Problem-solution fit articulation
- Value proposition clarity
- Market opportunity sizing

#### 4. **Similar Startups Analysis**

- 3-5 direct/indirect competitors
- Their business models and approaches
- Success/failure patterns
- Market gap identification

#### 5. **Improvement Suggestions**

- Feature enhancement recommendations
- Market positioning improvements
- Partnership opportunities
- Monetization strategy refinements

#### 6. **Success Probability & Market Stats**

- Industry success/failure rates
- Market size and growth projections
- Key success factors
- Risk assessment and mitigation
